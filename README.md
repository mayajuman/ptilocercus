Data and code for our study on morphometric variation in *Ptilocercus lowii* (Juman et al. 2021)

# Overview
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10914-021-09556-7" target="_blank">This study</a> focused on skeletal variation in Pen-tailed Treeshrews (*Ptilocercus lowii*) from Southeast Asia. I analyzed multivariate morphometric data from the skulls and postcrania of museum specimens to examine infraspecific taxonomic boundaries. We discovered substantial divergence between the two currently recognized subspecies, *P. l. lowii* and *P. l. continentis*. Future research may confirm that these two populations represent distinct species. We also observed that specimens from the Mentawai Islands appear cranially distinct from other populations, but more robust sample sizes are necessary for further investigation.
